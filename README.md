# FOSSEE Semester Long Internship – Python Screening Task 2

## Task Objective
Craft a clear, effective natural-language prompt that guides an AI assistant to help a student debug Python code without revealing the full solution.

---

## Submitted Prompt
See [Prompt.md](./Prompt.md) for the final submitted prompt.

---

## Reasoning

### Why worded this way?
- Step-by-step instructions ensure consistent AI behavior.
- Phrases like *“constructive hints”* and *“leading questions”* focus on guidance, not giving answers.
- Explicitly instructs *not to provide full corrected solution*.

### How it avoids giving the solution
- AI is told to explain and give hints, not code corrections.
- Leading questions encourage problem-solving by students.
- Reinforces “teach, don’t tell.”

### How it encourages helpful feedback
- Supportive, confidence-building tone.
- Beginner-friendly explanations.
- Encourages thinking instead of spoon-feeding.

## Required Q&A

**Q1. What tone and style should the AI use when responding?**  
Supportive, patient, beginner-friendly, encouraging.  

**Q2. How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?**  
Point out likely error spots, explain the concept, and ask guiding questions instead of giving final code.  

**Q3. How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?**  
- Beginners → simple step-by-step hints, examples, plain language.  
- Advanced learners → technical explanations, fewer hints, more conceptual questions.
